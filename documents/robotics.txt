Robotics is a rapidly advancing field of technology that deals with the design, construction, operation, and application of robots. The term itself, derived from the Czech word 'rabota' meaning worker, points to the core purpose of robotics: to create machines that can perform tasks traditionally done by humans. A key feature that distinguishes a robot from a simple machine is its control by a computer program, which allows it to perform a complex series of actions automatically and repeatedly. While robots come in a vast array of shapes and sizes, they generally share a set of core components: Manipulator/Rover, End Effector, Actuators, Sensors, and Controller. A significant milestone was the creation of "Shakey" in the 1960s by the Stanford Research Institute. Shakey was the first mobile robot to reason about its own actions. The term "robotics" was coined by the science fiction author Isaac Asimov in the 1940s. He also famously proposed his "Three Laws of Robotics." The applications of robotics are vast and continue to expand: Industrial Automation, Hazardous Environments, Medical Field, Logistics and Warehousing, and Consumer and Domestic Use. The future of robotics is intrinsically linked with the progress of artificial intelligence and machine learning.
