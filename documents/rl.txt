Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of machine learning that enables a computer to learn through trial and error. It is one of the three main paradigms of machine learning, along with supervised and unsupervised learning. The core components of RL are the agent and the environment. The agent is the learner or decision-maker, and the environment is the world it interacts with. The agent takes actions in the environment, which causes the environment to transition to a new state. After each action, the agent receives a reward or a punishment from the environment. This feedback helps the agent understand which actions are beneficial and which are not. The goal of the agent is to maximize its cumulative reward over time. Unlike other machine learning methods, RL doesn't require a pre-existing dataset. Instead, the agent learns directly from its interactions with the environment. RL problems are often modeled as Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Deep Reinforcement Learning is a more advanced form of RL that uses deep neural networks to solve complex problems. Reinforcement learning has a wide range of applications, including: Robotics, Game Playing, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Industrial Automation.
