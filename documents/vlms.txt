Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are a class of artificial intelligence (AI) models that integrate computer vision and natural language processing (NLP), allowing them to understand and generate language based on visual inputs. These models are designed to process and comprehend both images and text simultaneously, enabling them to perform advanced tasks that require a deep understanding of both modalities. VLMs typically consist of a few key components that work together to bridge the gap between sight and speech. At their core, they process two distinct types of input: images and text. An Image Encoder, often a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) or a Vision Transformer (ViT), converts the image into a dense feature representation. A Text Encoder processes the textual input. A crucial step is the alignment of visual and textual features in a shared embedding space, where the model learns to associate concepts. Finally, a decoder, often a large language model, uses the combined and aligned representations to generate text as output. The ability of VLMs to connect vision and language has opened up a wide range of applications: Image Captioning, Visual Question Answering (VQA), Text-to-Image Generation, Image Search and Retrieval, and Object Detection and Segmentation. Several influential Vision-Language Models have been developed, including CLIP (Contrastive Languageâ€“Image Pre-training), DALL-E, and ALIGN (A Large-scale ImaGe and Noisy-text embedding).
